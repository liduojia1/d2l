# Requesting discounts on dining hall meals for Saturday volunteers

Created: March 31, 2022 4:33 PM

Dear Dean [Name], 

My name is [Name] and I've been planning a park beautification initiative called [Perk Up the Parks](../../../../Initiatives%203f0745b8ac9c43e798588efdc7389283/Perk%20Up%20the%20Parks%20cd830e2911e34067ac4201a94fe3019b.md) with my club. We were wondering if we could purchase 150 pre-paid dining hall meals for our volunteers at a discounted rate every Saturday for 8 weeks, starting on September 15th. We currently have raised $3400 for transportation. 

Best,
